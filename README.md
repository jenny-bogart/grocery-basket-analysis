## Grocery Store Market Basket Analysis

### Problem Statement
Retailers want to understand which products are commonly bought together to optimize product placement, customer recommendations, and promotions. This project analyzes grocery transaction data to uncover underlying purchasing trends and show the likelihood of a customer purchasing a product and purchasing additional products

### Dataset
The dataset I used contains transaction data from 2023-2025 from a multi location grocery chain. Each row represents an item purchased in a transaction, including transaction date, product information, and quantity.
